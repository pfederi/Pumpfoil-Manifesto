# Pumpfoiling - Code of Conduct

We believe that the Pumpfoiling Code of Conduct is a living document that can benefit from the contributions and insights of the entire pumpfoiling community. Therefore, we have decided to make the Code of Conduct open-source and share it here on GitHub. By making the Code of Conduct open-source, we hope to foster a culture of collaboration, transparency, and innovation in the pumpfoiling community, and to encourage others to share their ideas, feedback, and suggestions to improve the Code of Conduct over time. We invite all pumpfoiling enthusiasts to join us in this effort and to help us shape the future of pumpfoiling by contributing to the Pumpfoiling Code of Conduct on GitHub.
