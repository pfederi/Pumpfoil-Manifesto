# Pumpfoiling-Manifesto

We believe that the Pumpfoiling Manifesto is a living document that can benefit from the contributions and insights of the entire pumpfoil community. Therefore, we have decided to make the manifesto open-source and share it here on GitHub. By making the manifesto open-source, we hope to foster a culture of collaboration, transparency, and innovation in the pumpfoiling community, and to encourage others to share their ideas, feedback, and suggestions to improve the manifesto over time. We invite all pumpfoil enthusiasts to join us in this effort and to help us shape the future of pumpfoiling by contributing to the Pumpfoiling Manifesto on GitHub.
